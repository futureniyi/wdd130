        <h2>Lagos, Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/Jubilee_bridge.jpg" alt="Lagos Jubilee Bridge" width="200" height="133">
        <p>Lagos is a city of two realities merged into one. It is a place where busy yellow buses and motorcycles move
            alongside fancy cars, where street vendors sell snacks under tall billboards, and where old traditions live
            beside modern technology. Lagos is full of noise, energy, and life. People are always moving, working, and
            chasing their dreams. In one moment, you can be stuck in traffic, and in the next, you can be having a
            meeting in a tall office building. Lagos shows the difference between the rich and the poor, the formal and
            the informal, but all these parts come together to create one strong and vibrant city.</p>
