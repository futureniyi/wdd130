                <p>12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>

        <h2>Lagos, Nigeria</h2>

        <p>Lagos is a city of two realities merged into one. It is a place where busy yellow buses and motorcycles move alongside fancy cars, where street vendors sell snacks under tall billboards, and where old traditions live beside modern technology. Lagos is full of noise, energy, and life. People are always moving, working, and chasing their dreams. In one moment, you can be stuck in traffic, and in the next, you can be having a meeting in a tall office building. Lagos shows the difference between the rich and the poor, the formal and the informal, but all these parts come together to create one strong and vibrant city.</p>
